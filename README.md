# Linked Lists

[**Link to Assignment**](https://baguirre03.github.io/weather-app/)

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

## What I learned

I learned a lot doing this and it was actually quite fun! It was not too hard to implement as I think that TOP had prepared me for this assignment quite well. The only problem was was having to `console.log()` each of the functions to test them. Other than that I used node to implement run the file within my console.

## Features

`append(value)`- adds a new node containing `value` to the end of the list
`prepend(value)`- adds a new node containing `value` to the start of the list
`size()`- returns the total number of nodes in the list
`head()`- returns the first node in the list
`tail()`- returns the last node in the list
`at(index)`- returns the node at the given `index`
`pop()`- removes the last element from the list
`contains(value)`- returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
`find(value)` - returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
`toString()` - represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: `( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null`
`insertAt(value, index)` - inserts a new node with the provided `value` at the given `index`.

- All of the tests on the bottom have a comment providing what they should return.
